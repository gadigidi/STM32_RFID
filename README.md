# Project Overview #

This repository is a **hands-on STM32 firmware learning project**.

The goal is to gain **practical experience** with STM32 microcontrollers through direct work
with peripherals and **register-level programming**, focusing on learning by doing rather than
production-ready code.

All development and testing are performed on **real STM32 hardware**, using physical wiring
and external peripherals.

The project is built **incrementally**, with each stage focusing on a specific peripheral or concept.
It is **continuously updated** as new topics are explored and understanding evolves.
Over time, these building blocks are combined into a more complete system.

This repository represents an **ongoing learning process**, not a final product.

# Implemented #

- **Joystick driver**  
  Analog joystick interfaced via ADC for hands-on experimentation with analog inputs and signal sampling.

- **4-digit 7-segment display driver**  
  7-segment display driven directly from GPIO pins to practice low-level output control and timing.
