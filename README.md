Project Overview
################

This repository is a hands-on STM32 firmware learning project.

The goal is to gain practical experience with STM32 microcontrollers through direct work with peripherals and register-level programming, focusing on learning by doing rather than production-ready code.
Development Approach.

All development and testing are done on real STM32 hardware with physical wiring and external peripherals.

The project is built incrementally, with each stage focusing on a specific peripheral or concept.
It is continuously updated as new topics are explored and understanding evolves, and represents an ongoing learning process, not a final product.
Over time, these building blocks will be combined into a more complete system.
